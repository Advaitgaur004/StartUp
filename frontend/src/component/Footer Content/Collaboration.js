        <p>Dear valued clients of IITIAN_VIBES,</p>
        <p>
          We appreciate your interest in collaborating with us. However, at this
          time, we are not actively pursuing new collaboration opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We value your support and enthusiasm, and we will keep you updated if
          our collaboration status changes in the future.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>
